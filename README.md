There is no fancy and secret DWORDs for AMD gpus, some people will try to sell you some "secret" keys, don't fall for them.

Already modded drivers from Pablerso: https://github.com/Pablerso/AMD-Drivers-Modded

If you want to strip the driver yourself, here is the @amitxvv's guide https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vd5WKWhm77sG8o9xBoSNRuAWRTavLqynJ7aQhVrsa8Y

**AMD Have changed their DWORDs at somewhere, I don't know specific version when AMD dwords have changed, but if you are using 22.xx.xx drivers, go with new version batch file.**
